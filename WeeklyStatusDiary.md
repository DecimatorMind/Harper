## Week-1

We have firstly researched different websites for good UI Mockups that are available. Then we discussed about the tools that we need to make our project. We searched for the icons and the wallpapers on the internet that we need and that best suits our UI. Then we incorporated the icons and wallpapers to make a UI mockup that represents our idea that how our application may look in the future. We have also made a Git repository on Github and we have pushed the project to the repository. We made a few mockup designs and discussed about what will suit best.

## Week-2

Using the UI-UX Mockups made last week, we made the Xcode and Android Studio projects. Before starting working on the projects, we first discussed about the method to be used in the login and registration of the user (Authentication). We decided to use Email Authentication using Firebase API, which will allow us to store the email and password for future API queries. Then we started working on the projects. The first step was to make the UI Login Design in the IDE. Therefore we made the login page as per the mockup and added the login functionalities. By the end of the week, it was visible if the user could login or not.

## Week-3

In this week we worked on the Registration page and registering new users to the Google Firebase Authentication. The registration page was not made in the mockups, and we used the same design as the login page to keep the design consistent. Also we worked on the code to create a segue from the main activity to the registration activity. We also discussed about the segues from the registration page. Also the Main Activity that is the music player was also created and connected to the login activity as well as registration activity using segues.

## Week-4

In this week we worked on the MainActivity and started off with the backend database connection. In order to use the main activity we had to first connect it to the backend local database. Therefore we have made the UI of the main activity and connected to the other activities as well as the backend database, so that the music can be played using the main activity. We have used SQLite for the backend database, where the local songs are stored. The SQLite has to be connected first to the backend database for the intial UI testing. The functioning of the Main Activity will take much more time than we thought, therefore we had to skip the integration of backend database.

## Week-5

This week we worked on the Music Player that would be functional, but the song data will have to be copied to the project rather than using the database. This week we will complete the basic functionality of the music player with some additional features like background play, pause, Image Switch, SeekBar Functionality, Current Time, Duration calculation and many other small details that are very important to be implemented before we start making the database. After the Music Player is completed, we will work on the Backend of the application that is the local database.

## Week-6

Starting the work on the Database (Backend) in order to achieve all functionalities of the player. This week the work was postponed to next week due to the mid term examination.Although a few code updates will be done this week, but those would to increase the readability and efficiency and to reduce the redundancy in the code.

## Week-7

This week we started working on the connection to the Youtube API. Since the time to the evaluation is less, therefore rather than connecting permanent database to the application, we first wanna do the basic functions of the application. The data must be received and stored in the application. The permanent storage is not much important at this stage of the application. Although a big part of application includes storing into backend local database, but that part can be easily done once all the data can be retrieved. The data can be soon easily structured and stored to the local storage.

## Week-8

This week we tried various APIs and tried to retrieve various sorts of data. But we failed to achieve what we had expected. We have tried using multiple cocoapods and frameworks to easily retrieve any music file. But we fail to. Therefore we have been looking for various other ways that can be used to make for the shortcomings. One of the ways that we are researching to do was to convert the video to mp3 file, using basic conversion. But that would decrease the efficiency.

# November

## Week-9

This week we tried using the method where we convert mp4 file to mp3 file, but there is no direct way to retrieve the mp4 video directly. Therefore we are looking for any other such method to show how we are expecting the application to work. We have been planning to use firebase as our server. We are looking forward to a mechanism where we would create our own server that would return the mp3 file in request. But since that would take time, we will be still researching and working on the last module of the project.

## Week-1

We have firstly researched different websites for good UI Mockups that are available. Then we discussed about the tools that we need to make our project. We searched for the icons and the wallpapers on the internet that we need and that best suits our UI. Then we incorporated the icons and wallpapers to make a UI mockup that represents our idea that how our application may look in the future. We have also made a Git repository on Github and we have pushed the project to the repository. We made a few mockup designs and discussed about what will suit best.

# September

## Week-1

We have firstly researched different websites for good UI Mockups that are available. Then we discussed about the tools that we need to make our project. We searched for the icons and the wallpapers on the internet that we need and that best suits our UI. Then we incorporated the icons and wallpapers to make a UI mockup that represents our idea that how our application may look in the future. We have also made a Git repository on Github and we have pushed the project to the repository. We made a few mockup designs and discussed about what will suit best.

## Week-2

Using the UI-UX Mockups made last week, we made the Xcode and Android Studio projects. Before starting working on the projects, we first discussed about the method to be used in the login and registratio of the user (Authentication). We decided to use Email Authentication using Firebase API, which will allow us to store the email and password for future API queries. Then we started working on the projects. The first step was to make the UI Login Design in the IDE. Therefore we made the login page as per the mockup and added the login functionalities. By the end of the week, it was visible if the user could login or not.

## Week-3

In this week we worked on the Registration page and registering new users to the Google Firebase Authentication. The registration page was not made in the mockups, and we used the same design as the login page to keep the design consistent. Also we worked on the code to create a segue from the main activity to the registration activity. We also discussed about the segues from the registration page. Also the Main Activity that is the music player was also created and connected to the login activity as well as registration activity using segues.
